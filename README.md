# Focault-Pendulum
In this proyect, we will see the movement of the focault pendulum in two ways:


### Pendulum without friction:

Maybe this is the ideal way to have a pendulum, but nothing is like in the vacuum

### Pendulum with linear friction:

In this, we consider turbulence by the air, using Reynol's number.
